# Problems With Code
#### I Have Completely Hard Coded This game when making. When the game was ready I realised that I can't change stuffs easily (For Instance Paddle's Speed, Ball Speed). But a postive thing is it does not impact the functioning of game. :smile: Try Not To Judge Me So Hard..... After All I am just a Beginner. :grin:

# Finally Thank You! For trying my game. :innocent:
